Breast cancer prediction using Deep Nueral Network


Background
Breast cancer is a type of cancer with high mortality rates among women, and it is one of the most common causes of death in women.
According to the National Cancer Institue statistics in USA, one out of eight women suffers from breast cancer and 6% of all deaths worldwide
are caused by this type of cancer.
Early diagnosis and accurate diagnosis of breast cancer is of prime importance as it will increase the survival chances. Thus, a precise and
reliable system is essential for the timely diagnosis of benign or malignant breast tumors.

Objective
The key objective is to develop a model to predict breast cancer as benign or malignant using the data set from the digitized image of FNA
sample.
Radiologists conduct Fine Needle Aspirate (FNA) procedure of breast tumor. FNA is a non invasive technique for detecting breast cancer. This
procedure reveals features such as tumor radius, area, perimeter, concavity, texture and fractal dimensions. These features are further studied
by medical experts to classify tumor as benign or malignant. Pathologists require a lot of skill and expertise to perform the analysis on the FNA
sample. Applyting the suitable features of the FNA results in the most important diagnostic problem in early stages of breast cancer. Hence,
development of algorithms which provide accurate predictions is of great interest.

Dataset used - Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Data set
Features in the dataset are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe the characteristics of the
cell nuclei present in the image
